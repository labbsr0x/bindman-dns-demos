# Bindman-DNS Agent

On each folder of this repository you will find a complete example of how to get up and running with a Bindman-DNS Agent.

A Bindman-DNS Agent defines itself only at runtime, having listeners and managers talking to each over a network.

A listener is not aware of implementation-specific information from the manager. The otherwise also holds.
